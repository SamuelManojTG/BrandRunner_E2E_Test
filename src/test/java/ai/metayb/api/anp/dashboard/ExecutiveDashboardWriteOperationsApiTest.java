/**
 * "02. ANP / Executive Dashboard" - 21 Postman requests across 4 distinct routes:
 *   - Executive Pending Aging (POST /web/anp-dashboard-v2/executive/pending-approval-aging) - 3 variants
 *   - Regional Spend Heat Map (POST .../executive/regional-spend-heat-map) - 6 variants
 *   - Top Locations (POST .../executive/top-location) - 6 variants
 *   - Top Activities (POST .../executive/top-activities) - 6 variants
 *
 * NOT AUTOMATED in this QA environment - same systemic CloudFront/S3 SPA-fallback root
 * cause. Verified live for "Regional Spend Heat Map" (approved - all filters) directly -
 * returned HTML instead of JSON. The other 3 routes are documented on that same
 * evidence, per the "spot-check per sub-area" approach.
